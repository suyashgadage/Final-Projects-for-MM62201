## Projects

### Project 1 : Medical Transcription Analysis

1. The project aims to analyse the medical transcription dataset. The dataset is located in the `data/medical_transcriptions/mtsamples.csv` directory.
2. The dataset is a `csv` file. `CSV` stands for `C`omma `S`eparated `V`alues. It is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.
3. The dataset contains following fields :
   - `description` : Short brief of the interaction between the patient and the doctor.
   - `medical_specialty` : Medical specialty of the issue discussed in the transcription.
   - `sample_name` : Medical Samples used for the diagnosis.
   - `transcription` : Full transcription of the interaction between the patient and the doctor.
   - `keywords` : Keywords of the transcription
4. The project can be divided into sub-areas as follows :
   - `Data Preprocessing`
        1. Write functions to read the csv file. Suggestion : Use the `pandas` library.
        2. This dataset needs bit of pre-processing. The `medical_specialty` field contains multiple values. You need to split the values and create a list of values. For example, if the `medical_specialty` field contains `Orthopedics, Neurology`, then you need to split it into `['Orthopedics', 'Neurology']`.
        3. The keywords field contains multiple values. You need to split the values and transform it into a list of values. For example, if the `keywords` field contains `'pain, headache, migraine'`, then you need to split it into `['pain', 'headache', 'migraine']`.
        4. Look into the dataset and find out if there are any other fields that need to be pre-processed.
   - `Data Analysis`
        1. In this part you can prepare a set of questions at least 10 and answer them using the dataset.
        2. Some examples questions to get you started:
            * What is the `most common` medical specialty?
            * What is the `most common` medical sample?
            * What is the `most common` keyword?
            * What is the `average` length of the transcription?
            * What is the `average` length of the description?
            * What is the `average` length of the keywords?
            * And so on... Get creative and come up with your own questions.
   - `Data Visualization`
        1. In this part you can make use of the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries to visualize the answers to the questions you asked in the previous part.
        2. Everyone likes to see the results in the form of `graphs` and `charts`. So, make sure you visualize the answers to the questions you asked in the previous part.

   1. `Hippocampus MRI` images and segmentation masks
   2. `Heart MRI` images and segmentation masks
   3. `Prostate MRI` images and segmentation masks
   4. `Abdomen CT` images and segmentation masks
4. These scans are used to diagnose the diseases of the body. The segmentation masks are used to identify the different parts of the body in the images.
5. Scans are in `NIFTI` format. `NIFTI` is a standard format for storing medical images.
6. All the scans are `3D Volumes`. Each 3D volume is a stack of `2D images`. Each 2D image is called a `slice`.
7. Your first task is to read the images and visualize them. You can use the `nibabel` library to read the images.
8. Visualizing the images is important to understand the data. You can use the `matplotlib` library to visualize the images. Visualization can be done in multiple ways. You can visualize the images in the following ways:
   1. Visualize the `slices` of the images and the segmentation masks.
   2. Visualize the `3D volumes` of the images and the segmentation masks.
9. The next task is to analyze the images. You can use the `numpy` library to analyze the images. The analysis part is open ended.
10. You can perform simple statistical analysis on the images. You can also perform more complex analysis like `image segmentation` and `image classification`.
11. Statistical analysis may include the following:
    1. Calculate the `mean`, `median`, `standard deviation`, `minimum` and `maxmum` for the whole image, segmented image.
    2. Now compare the statistics of the segmented image with the whole image. What do you observe?
12. Complex analysis may include the following:
    1. Perform `image segmentation` on the images. You can use the `scikit-image` library to perform image segmentation.
    2. Perform `image classification` on the images. You can use the `scikit-learn` library to perform image classification.
    3. You can also perform `image registration` on the images. You can use the `SimpleITK` library to perform image registration.
12. Try with statistical analysis first and then move on to more complex analysis. Although, we do not expect you to perform complex analysis, you can try it if you want to.
13. Remember, the analysis part is open ended. You can come up with your own analysis ideas and implement them.

 ### Project 4 : Impact of Soil Quality on Crop Growth Analysis

1. This project aims to explore how soil quality (nutrients, pH) and weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall) influence different crops. The dataset is located in the `data/crop_growth/` directory.
2. By analyzing this data, you will identify patterns and insights that can help to classify the type of crop grown in different regions based on these soil and weather factors.
3. Go through the data files and understand the data. You can use the `pandas` library to read the csv files and perform analysis on the data.
4. The project can be divided into the following parts:
   - `Data Preprocessing`
     * `Handling Missing Values`: a) Check for missing values in soil nutrient data (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
        b) Use imputation techniques like mean or median imputation for continuous variables such as nutrient levels, pH, and weather data.
     * `Feature Scaling`: a) Normalize the soil nutrient levels, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall to bring them onto a comparable scale.
        This is important for analysis and visualization purposes.
     * `Encoding Categorical Data`: a) Convert the categorical feature crop label into numerical form using one-hot encoding or label encoding,
        so that it can be included in the analysis.
    - `Data Analysis`
      * `Descriptive Statistics`: a) Compute summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for all continuous features (soil nutrients, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall)           to understand the distribution of these variables for different crop types.
      * `Correlation Analysis`: a) Examine the correlation between features (soil nutrients, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall) to understand how soil and weather    
         conditions relate to each other. Use correlation matrices to visualize these relationships.
    - `Data Visualization`
      * `Feature Distributions`: a) Use histograms or box plots to visualize the distribution of key features (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, temperature, humidity,           rainfall) across different crop types. This will help in understanding which factors are more prevalent for certain crops.
      * `Pair Plots`: a) Generate pair plots to visualize relationships between different features for each crop type. Pair plots can show how soil nutrients and weather           conditions are distributed across crops and how they might interact with each other.
      * `Heatmap for Correlation`: a) Create a heatmap to show the correlation between features (soil nutrients, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall).
         This will highlight strong correlations between variables that may influence crop type classification.
      * `Bar Charts for Crop Type Distribution`: a) Use bar charts to visualize the distribution of the crop type across different ranges of soil and weather features.
         For example, you can create bar charts showing the count of each crop type at various pH levels or nitrogen concentrations.
      * `Scatter Plots`: a) Plot scatter plots with soil nutrients (e.g., nitrogen vs. phosphorus) on the axes, color-coded by crop type, to visually assess which crops             prefer specific soil nutrient combinations.
5. You can use the `pandas` library for handling missing data, imputation, encoding, and descriptive statistics.
6. For scaling features and encoding categorical data, you can use `scikit-learn` library.
7. The `seaborn` and `matplotlib` library is used for creating visualizations like pair plots, heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
8. You can try to develop a classification model to predict crop types based on soil and weather features and evaluate their performance. Although, we do not expect you to build the classification model, you can try it if you want to. -->

### Project 5 : Plant Disease Analysis Using Leaf Image Data

1. The aim of this project is to identify plant diseases from images of leaves using image processing and machine learning techniques. The dataset is located in the `data/plant_disease/` directory.
2. By analyzing the key visual differences between healthy and diseased plant leaves, the project aims to automate disease detection, which can help farmers and agricultural experts identify problems early and take action to improve crop health.
3. This project can be divided into the following parts:
   - `Image Processing`
     * `Image Resizing`: Resize all images to a uniform dimension (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256 pixels) to ensure consistent input size across the dataset.
       This step ensures that the images are compatible with deep learning models, which require fixed input dimensions.
       You can use `OpenCV` or `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) to resize the images.
     * `Normalization`: Scale pixel values from a range of 0-255 to 0-1. This ensures that the features (pixel values) are on a comparable scale, which aids in faster and better model convergence during training.
   - `Data Analysis`
     * `Statistical Analysis`: Perform descriptive statistical analysis of the dataset to explore the distribution of images across different disease categories. This includes computing the number of samples per disease class and assessing whether there are any class imbalances (i.e., some diseases having significantly more samples than others).
     * `Pixel Intensity Analysis`: Examine the pixel intensity values of the images to identify key differences between healthy and diseased leaves.
       This analysis involves comparing pixel distributions (e.g., histograms of pixel values) for each class to see if certain patterns (such as darker or lighter regions) are characteristic of diseases.
     * You can use `pandas` to analyze class distributions and check for imbalances.
   - `Data Visualization`
     * `Image Grid Visualization`: Create grids of sample images for each disease class to visually assess the variations within and across the classes.
        This helps in identifying visual patterns, such as texture or color differences, that may be indicative of disease. To create image grids, you can use `matplotlib` library.
     * `Dimensionality Reduction (PCA or t-SNE)`: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce the high-dimensional image data to 2D or 3D space. This allows for visualization of the relationships between images and how different diseases cluster together. You can use `scikit-learn` library to perform PCA or t-SNE for feature reduction.
4. Remember, the analysis part is open-ended. You can come up with your own analysis ideas and implement them.
5. You can try to develop a deep learning model for plant disease detection and evaluate their performance. Although, we do not expect you to build the detection model, you can try it if you want to.

     * ` Data Balancing`: If there is a class imbalance (e.g., significantly more non-PCOS cases), apply techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes using `imblearn.over_sampling` library.
   - `Data Analysis`
     * `Descriptive Analysis`: Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for clinical features such as BMI, and blood glucose.
     * `Correlation Analysis`: Assess relationships between features and their influence on PCOS. Use correlation matrices to visualize these relationships. You can use `seaborn` library for visualization.
     * `Statistical Testing`: Use hypothesis testing (e.g., Chi-Square Test, ANOVA) to examine the association between categorical variables (e.g., Pregnant) and the presence of PCOS. The `scipy.stats` can be used for this testing.
   - `Data Visualization`

You may find out basic statistical measures such as (mean, median, etc.) for each features. If any field contains multiple values. You need to split the values and transform it into a list of values.
        1. In this part, you need to prepare a set of questions and answer them using the data provided.
        2. Answer `at least 15 questions` using the data provided.
        3. A few examples questions to get you started are as follows:
            *  How do baseline BDI-II scores vary across disease groups (`condition_type`)?
            *  Are there noticeable differences in baseline depression levels between hospitals( `hospital_id`)?
            *  What is the average reduction in depression score for participants who completed all sessions versus those who did not?
            *  Are there differences in 12-week outcomes by sex, age group, or disease group?
            *  Which factors (demographic, clinical, or therapy-related) most strongly predict short-term depression improvement?
            *  What proportion of patients experience relapse or worsening after the 12-week period?
        d. You can come up with your own questions and answer them using the data provided.
     
    - `Data Visualization:` Make sure you potray all your data analysis using some plots, pie charts, bar charts, heatmaps as per the suitability.
  
        1. Use histograms (age), Bar chart or Pie chart (sex distribution)
        2. Visualize how many patients started vs. completed mindfulness sessions (e.g., stacked bar or pie chart).
        3. Use paired line plots or boxplots to compare baseline vs. 12-week BDI-II scores.
        4. Use Scatterplot (sessions completed vs. BDI change)
        5. Use Line plot (BDI over time) or Paired Dot plot (12 vs. 24 weeks)
               
6. The analysis part is open-ended. You can come up with your own analysis ideas and implement them.

### Project 9 : Monitoring Glucose, Heart Rate, and Activity Patterns in Personalized Nutrition

  1. The goal of this project is to explore how physiological and lifestyle factors relate to glucose regulation in 10 participants.
  2. The dataset is located in `data\nutrition\` directory.
  3. You will work with:
     - CGMacros-00XX.csv: Time-series data per participant including glucose (Libre GL), heart rate (HR), calories burned, and METs.
     - bio.csv: Baseline characteristics and lab measurements including BMI, A1c, fasting glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and fingerstick glucose readings.

  4. `Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:` Write functions to read the csv file. Suggestion : Use the `pandas` library. The dataset may contain missing values, NaN values, or invalid entries. Use suitable imputation techniques for data cleaning and filling missing entries. Understand the association between the datasets. Convert timestamps to datetime objects.
  
  5. `Data Analysis:` It includes visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) and calculating correlations between features. You may find out basic statistical measures such as (mean, median, etc.) for each features. 
        - In this part, you need to prepare a set of questions and answer them using the data provided.
        - Answer `at least 15 questions` using the data provided.
          
            -  How does Libre GL glucose vary over time for each participant?
            -  How do heart rate, calories, and METs vary during the day for each participant?
            -  Compare average glucose (Libre GL) between participants.
            -  Does higher heart rate associate with lower or higher glucose spikes?
            -  Identify the participant with highest glucose variability.
            -  Visualize daily activity vs. daily glucose averages for each participant.
            -  Compute average daily metrics (mean HR, mean glucose, calories burned) and plot across participants.
            -  What time of day tends to show the highest average glucose across participants?
            -  Compare male vs. female participants on fasting glucose, A1c, and average Libre GL.
         
  6. `Data Visualization:`
     -  Use line plots to analyze time-series data(glucose value from Libre GL varying over time). You can also plot for single metric or with multiple metrics such as heart rate, calorie values.
     -  Bar charts can be used for comparing average glucose between participants.
     -  Scatterplots can be used to showcase peak glucose levels with higher heart rate.
          
  4. The analysis is open-ended and you can frame your own questions. Use suitable plots to visualize your data.
